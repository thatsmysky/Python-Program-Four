Fuctions to draw shapes in Python Turtle

Program 4 Algorithm
Lucy Kull

Functions:

	One for each file needed

	Also one for if its not a file

		If its not a file, ask for a real one

Every function should include a way to attempt to open the file and what to do if it doesn’t exist as well as if it does

Ask user what file they want to open (maybe give them options)

Clear screen after each file is run

Ask if they want to open another file

Have command where, if user enters “Quit” the program ends.
